{"reviews": ["(from old notes - 7/25/2022)  12oz bottle from Woodmans in Waukesha. Aroma is very smooth; sweet malts, roast, barrel, and coconut are all strong components, in a smooth meld. Taste is rougher. The blend of the components, as well as some berry, and some anise, is well done. Has a sweet and smooth finish. Enjoyed this! 16.7", "(from old notes - 7/25/2022)  16oz can from Craft Beer Cellar in Pewaukee with no can date (yet a note to drink fresh?!), shared with GorjusGirl. Orange pinkish pour with little head. Aroma hits with huge fruit punch. Lots of pineapple, passionfruit and guava, with sweet fruits. Taste is almost as good; more of the sweetness comes through. Not deep, but very, very fruity. Sweet finish. Very nice and fuller than one would expect from the ABV. 14.9", "Very good IPA. Aroma was good. Fresh hay, cut grass and a hint of grain. Pour was a light brown with a one finger head. Taste was delicious. Very malty (as the dark color suggested) but a nice crisp green hop backbone and bitter finish. Good carbonation.

Complicated stuff. Exquisite flavor.", "(from old notes - 7/25/2022)  12oz can from ck1, thanks! 4 Unclear golden orange pour. Fairly hoppy with a nice mango component for a brew approaching 8 months from its can date -- yup, the timing didn't work. This is crushable with good bones. Unsure if the mildness is due to style or age of the hops. 13.6", "Basically it's a fresh resident hop beer with a little bit of weed and subtle coconut at the end. Nice balance between sweet, bitter and tart. I don't think the coconut really adds anything. Serviceable beer.", "(from old notes - 7/24/2022)  16oz can from Longtable in Middleton with a can date of 2 months ago. Hazy pour.

Not sweet, but with light sweetness. Finishes sweet, juicy and herbal, with fruit. Yum! 15.2", "Pours clear raspberry with a nice frothy and pinkish head. Aroma delivers tart and sweet passionfruit, dragonfruit (of course!) and honey. Flavor gives up zesty passionfruit and dragonfruit, dry honey notes. Texture produces decent body and peppy fizz.

Almost black pour with a brown/tan head. Aroma has ashes, sweet malts, and light hops. Taste is similar, adding some cherry. Still not much of a hop presence, but quite ashy. Finishes lightly sweet.

Refreshing take on a Canadian ale.", "(from old notes - 7/23/2022)  5oz pour from Craft Beer Cellar in Pewaukee - random decision to try after avoiding it years back around the Chicago area, and it being on tap here for several months. Pours very dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma has interesting spices with a bit of smokiness. Taste has light sweet malts, spices, and smoke. Not thick or deep. Finishes a bit short but smoky.

Taste follows, getting sweeter and sweeter. Shrug? The base brew is underneath, so the floor is solidly high on this one, but the sugars and sweetness drag it down near that floor. 14.3", "Varnish, bubblegum nose, volatile. Hazy amber, thin head.

Grapey, pruney, raisiny, just way, way, way too much of that character.  That's basically all this beer is.

This Mule interpretation had a snow white, moussy, creamy, slowly breaking head and milky pale straw blonde robe with greenish tinge.  Aroma of overripe cucumber, kefir, raw gherkin, wood sorrel, sourdough, green pear, sweaty socks somewhere, chalk, white soap, sugared white celery.  Crisp sour onset with lime, sorrel and green apple associations, hint of cucumber too, medium carbonated with slick, light but rounded mouthfeel; sourdoughy lactic acidity dominates the finish with a gentle wheat sourishness clearly underneath, all remaining crisp and fresh, with growing wheat soapiness towards the end and lingering lime and cucumber \u2018greenness\u2019 next to notes of celery and \u2013 very classic in a Berliner Weisse \u2013 chalk.  Solid and very quenching, a bit \u2018off\u2019 perhaps in comparison with the historical standards of the style but this typifies (and, frankly, graces) Mule\u2019s house style I guess.

Aroma of hard caramel, ground hazelnuts, a smoky accent (smoked bacon even!), dried medlar, clove, tea, hints of cigar leaf and unripe banana.  Sourish and sweetish onset, medlar and banana with a dash of apple peel but not as fruity as I would expect from the style; fizzy carb, slick mouthfeel.  \u2018Deep\u2019 wheaty sourishness and smoothness, caramelly barley on the edges quickly turning gently toasted-bitterish and showing again this smoky aspect which has nothing to do with real Dunkelweizen, but somehow fits in well.  Light tea- and clove-like spicy elements in the end too, caramelly maltiness and wheaty sourishness remaining the backbone of it all.  Bit odd due to that smoky element, but strangely \u2013 I guess the wheat does this \u2013 I still had the feeling I was drinking a Dunkelweizen somehow.  Solid and easily drinkable, as intended \u2013 good one.", "This sympathetic new brewery in Schaarbeek specializes in exploring German beer traditions so a K\u00f6lsch comes as no surprise \u2013 and even if Mule is not the first Belgian brewery to tackle this old regional style, I do expect them to do it right, considering their business plan\u2026  Snow white, stable, moussy, membrane-like lacing head, misty deep and pure \u2018old\u2019 golden robe.

Clean, crisp onset, sharply and very minerally carbonated; slick cereally malt body, restrained white-bready and grainy sweetishness with lingering minerality, in the end bittered by grassy, floral and slightly peppery hops while that sulfuric aspect returns retronasally.  Moderately long, dryish, quenching finish maintaining a good balance between malts and hops.

I would love to find out.  Anyway, rating from the 75 cl bottle from the BXL Beerfest pack, shared with Craftmember.  Thick, egg-white, cobweb-lacing, dense and stable head, clear pale orange \u2018old golden\u2019 robe, turning misty with sediment.  Aroma of green apple, unripe peach, wood sorrel, old dry sherry, fresh mugwort leaf, dust, wet wood, dry hay, grape skin, plum peel, sow thistle.  Astringent, tart onset but not in a vinegary way, lots of juiciness reminiscent of both red and green apples, hints of pear and unripe stonefruit, softish carb with somewhat oily, rounded mouthfeel.  Bread-crusty malt core dried by lactic tartness, woody tannins and ongoing sour fruit notes, ranging from green apple to unripe plum; a pronounced \u2018old\u2019 hop bitterness raises its head in the finishing stage, hayish, drying and even wormwoody, eventually becoming quite pronounced, but keeping pace with the dryness of the lactic acidity and wood effects.  Everything merges well in the end; I had a Cuv\u00e9e De Ranke the day after this one and even though it is hard to put my finger on it, there is certainly a difference, with the latter being a bit less bitter and mellower in general but certainly not less sour, as if more \u2018malse\u2019 lambic was used than in the BXL version.  I will stop guessing what the exact difference between both is now and grant Cuv\u00e9e BXL a high score because like the original Cuv\u00e9e De Ranke, it is a top notch \u2018versnijbier\u2019 of blonde and lambic, without any doubt.", "Can 44 cl.

Medium thick, moussy, pinkish-tinged off-white, quite stable head on a hazy \u2018brownish\u2019 peach blonde beer with \u2018dirty amber\u2019 glow; lots of free-floating yeast and protein, making the whole turn into a murky, muddy brown in the end, and lots of \u2018grit\u2019 from the raspberries as well \u2013 maybe filtering would have been a good option here, because as the Dutch saying goes, \u201cthey eye wants something too\u201d\u2026  Rather odd aroma of clear raspberry juice but not so much those typical tomato-like associations normally linked to this fruit apart from some sweet ripe cherry tomato perhaps, wet oak wood, red wine, weird and persistent off-flavours best compared with rotting Camembert or even rancid yoghurt, bread crust, nectarine, hint of wet cardboard.  Crisp, tart, juicy onset, indeed obvious raspberry juice with a touch of sour tomato and even an impression of blood orange, fizzy but very fine effervescence, vinous mouthfeel; bread-pulp-ish core soaked in the raspberry \u2018cider\u2019 effect with little real acidity as in \u2018normal\u2019 framboise, more a very yoghurty lactic tartness, remaining soft and mild.  Retronasal aspects of pink grapefruit or blood orange and some woody notes but limited tannins; red wine does pop up in the finish, accentuating the fruitiness of the whole, continuing in parallel with the raspberry juice flavour into a juicy finish.  Too bad for all that grit, dirty looks and those \u2018spoiled diary\u2019-like off-flavours, which unfortunately remained from the first drop till the last, but certainly an ambitious idea which might well work; the only thing lacking here is a more sleek, controlled and sophisticated execution.

Just a light haze on this burnished gold beer, small bubbly pale cream colour head. Palate is light and semi dry, good fine carbonation. Thinnish malts, mildly sweet. Decent orange peel. A little esters. Perfumey pine. Dry hop spicy finish. Neither Idaho or Lemondrop to the fore for me and that is a real disappointment.", "Hazy yellow and poured with a massive head. This  took some time to dissipate. Fruity medium body. This brewery usually produces some interesting beers  but this is not one of them.

Just reddish brown with a dense beige head. Intriguing aroma of crackery funk, spices, wormwood? Medium bodied, alive, spritzy.

Good.", "Hazy double IPA by La Source, pint from tap there (during the BXL Beerfest afterparty).  Snow white, moussy, shred-lacing, slowly breaking head on a cloudy yolk-yellow blonde beer with vaguely greenish tinge.  Aroma of dried lemon zest, pomelo juice, green mango, Conference pear, lemonbread, unripe banana, green onions, lemonbalm and a subtle \u2018dank\u2019 sweaty note.  Crisp, \u2018green-fruity\u2019 onset, green melon and unripe banana, crisp carbonation, supple yet sometimes slightly powdery mouthfeel (not that this bothers me in this kind of beers).  Soggy cracker-like malt core under primarily green and citric hop aromas, pomelo, green onion, lemongrass and lime zest notes, providing a pleasantly drying and spicy, grassy bitterness as well, more so than is typically the case in a NEDIPA.  The alcohol warms a little bit but remains generally well hidden \u2013 an important point for me especially in this type of beers.  Dry for a NEDIPA, but very decent, typical reliable Source quality I would argue.", "Deliberately \u2018amplified\u2019 version of Cuv\u00e9e de Mortagne (making use of champagne yeast to \u2018spike\u2019 the alcohol) aged in specific sherry barrels; from tap at BXL Beerfest, cheers Glenn!  No head at all (not even a ring of bubbles), cloudy dark mahogany brown robe with burgundy tinge, looking a bit \u2018muddy\u2019.  Very intense, beguiling bouquet of caramel liqueur, sweet sherry and lots of it, cashew nut pur\u00e9e, hazelnut oil, yellow raisins, madera sauce, brown rum, vanilla-scenting oak wood, tawny port, ripe banana and a vague \u2018wild\u2019 hint of farmland somewhere.  Densely sweet onset, candied cherries, yellow raisins and fried figs, flat carb, full and vinous to almost slightly syrupy body; \u2018banana pulp\u2019, cooked pear and candied fig notes over a hazelnutty, caramelly malt body, residual dark sugariness versus tannic and very vanilla-scenting woodiness in the end \u2013 followed by spicy notes and warming, port-, rum- and obviously sherry-like alcohol.  Barleywine-esque interpretation of what was originally intended as a quadrupel, but has evolved in its very own idiomatic way after so many years and so many mutations; in any case one of the more memorable beers of the festival, with a drinkability that is very clearly disproportionate with the hefty amount of alcohol it contains \u2013 I am not sure if I ever had a beer of this strength that hides is alcohol this well and made me think it was only half as strong.  Delicious.", "Rum barrel aged Canadian stout with seven spices; sampled at BXL Beerfest.  Yellowish mocha-beige, moussy, stable head, ink black robe.  Intensely spiced aroma, clove, cinnamon, anise and allspice upfront, far less obvious but still noticeable cardamom, nutmeg, ginger and vanilla, very clear rum as well, unsugared black chocolate, burnt toast, wet wood, black coffee, dried prunes, paraffin, \u2018Borstbollen\u2019 and Christmas cake.  Dense, dryish onset, hints of dried fig and dried blueberry, lively carbonated for style with full, oily body; rich smooth maltiness shifting between sweet toffee and bitter black chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness, under an enormous amount of ethereal, warming and inevitably astringent \u2018wintery\u2019 spiciness, further enhanced by the spicy character of the rum, which also adds a warming afterglow.  Again it is the clove, allspice, cinnamon and anise which are very prominent; nutmeg, cardamom and ginger are less clearly distinguishable and vanilla is all but lost in this spicy violence.  Technically a perfectly fine barrel aged stout, ruined by a complete and near-fatal overdose of spices, not my personal cup of tea but some will certainly enjoy this.", "Bottle.

Some mineral and light ester/phenol from the yeast underneath, alongside cracker and rustic grain-like malt notes.
