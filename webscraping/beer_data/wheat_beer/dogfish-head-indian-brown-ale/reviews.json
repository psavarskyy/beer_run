Hops are subtle but provide a tempering of the sweetness.", "Bottled on 1/21/09....Sampled on 5/13/09, poured into a wider wine glass. This beer pours thick with a medium lace. A dark brown-near black color. Medium carbonation, but didn\u2019t produce that much of a head. I can\u2019t stop sipping it! The flavors are outstanding, mainly sweet, but with a slight hoppy aftertaste. Thinking of the Rolling Stone\u2019s song, \"Brown Sugar\", as that is the main theme going on here. It\u2019s almost like a stout. Aroma is oak mixed with the sweets of the malts and sugar. Reminds me of a toned down, affordable version of the DFH Immort Ale, which is like 11% vs. 7.2% here. They only had one left at the local retailer, but I\u2019ll be looking out for more of this in the future.\r\nUPDATE: Bottled on 11/29/07 (sampled on 6/12/09)........Bought a 6-pack of this after loving the first single/sample I tried. I didn\u2019t really notice this until I drank the 4th one, that this may have aged a bit too long. Had a bit more of a sour taste, where that sweet balanced taste I liked maybe had fermented too much. I did notice the hops a little more though, which I guess is a good thing. Still tasted good and sweet, and was totally drinkable, just didn\u2019t seem how I preferred it before. Maybe it was just that this bottle was starting to turn, I dunno. I wouldn\u2019t let this one age much more than a year, just to be safe.", "Lately I\u2019ve really been into Indian Red Ales so maybe I picked this up at the wrong time.

The aroma is a malty chocolate and roasty coffee initially, but the chocolate fades.

Not sure if it is a good unique or not. Can clearly get traits from both the malty scotch style and the hoppier IPA/pale ale styles.

Creamy mouthful and not much of a hops presence. Pretty good brown ale.", "Aroma is an interesting cappuccino up front with some brown sugar and roasted malt when you explore it further. No hops at all in the scent; strange for dogfish head. Very pretty brown color with a light tan head of foam. Tastes roasty, slightly hoppy and sweet. Has a lot in common with a scotch ale but has more brown sugar, rather than malt sweetness. Has an interesting creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e quality about it. This was good; I feel it is a bit overrated.

Had no idea what to expect of style so a cool temperature seemed apt. Deepest, darkest brown and opaque with a fine, tight bead and a thin pad of sandy cream atop. Big waft of cocoa and rpasted carob dominates the nose with minor licks of tangerine, cola and root beer, burnt toast and burnt, savoury raisins. Creamy mouthfeel, velvety even. Rounded, sumptuous body with a smooth finish. Chocolate malts dominate here as the nose. A tannic, dark berry note in back gives it a fruity element and then it is all dusty cocoa powder, carob and chocolate icecream in the finish. Light rust and blood, a higher, heated alcohol kick and plenty of wood and peanut husks in the aftertaste give it complexity. This is a nice brew. More Brown ale than Scotch ale and by no means showing any inkling of IPA. Great drinking though! (12fl.Oz, Bottled on 05/07/14, The Liquor Shed, Jandakot)", "12 fl. oz. bottle.

It\u2019s always the same. \r\nThe appearance was a nice dark brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipates within about a minute and left some light semi - thick lacing in its wake. \r\nThe smell was awesome as it had a super nice allocation of the Scottish peat - like smokey/roasty malts to the engraving bittersweet citrus hops to delightfully entice my nose to partake in more whiffs to get some light roasty caramel nuttiness about it.\r\nThe taste replicates the smell pretty much exactly the same.\r\nOn the palate, this one sits about a medium.

A roasted malt flavor with nice toasted nut and a little bit of of coffee flavors round out the taste, leaving a rather satisfying taste in the mouth.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel \u2013 The thicker body suits this beer quite nice. Mixed with the slightly linger carbonation it allows the brew to linger on the tongue; creating a very nice mouthfeel. \r\n\r\nOverall \u2013 This is one very nice beer. While not the most potent, the sweet maltiness mixed with the thicker mouthfeel and roasty flavor make this a great brew to sit and sip slowly over a relaxing evening.", "Bottle - Nutty flavor, malt and a little bit of hops on this one.

Alcohol, dark berries, and earthy hops in the nose, thick and slightly-cloying mouthfeel with rich malt, alcohol esters, and back-tongue bitterness in the middle, and eatery-fruity malt and satisfying bitterness at the end, finishing in malt rather than citrus or astringent.

Fantastic stuff.", "Dark brew with no head. Smells of roasted malts, alcohol, and freshly dug dirt. Taste is kinda smokey, coffee, earth, bitter, dry, herbal.

The head is a two finger mocha shade. It has a wonderfully soft texture, and as it fades away, leaves behind plenty of lacing on the glass.\r\n\r\nS: I don\u2019t really pick up a ton of hops...at first. There\u2019s a pleasant wave of brown sugar, nuts, and chocolate at first. Hops build up as it unravels in the glass, revealing both piny and herbal qualities. Maybe even a touch of mint. I must say, the hops are VERY well integrated within the maltier aspects of the aroma.\r\n\r\nT: Aye...this is a bit of a letdown next to the nose. Subdued hops open this up - providing notes of grapefruit, mint, and pine - and roll all the way to the back end, being propped up by caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and faint chocolate. This malt backbone builds up on the finish, slowly but gradually. My problem here is that it seems like a cross between a boring IPA and a boring brown ale - it hybridizes the two styles well enough, but comes off blandly. When people rag on \u2019balanced\u2019 brews, this is exactly what they\u2019d rag on. Actually, come to think of it, since it\u2019s too sweet, that would make it imbalanced...\r\n\r\nM: It finishes rather sweet, and unfortunately, the hops don\u2019t really dry it out as much as I\u2019d like. Even worse, it lacks the creaminess I like out of most sweetish brews. For that reason, it\u2019s hard to drink. On the plus side, there\u2019s no remote hint of harshness in the feel.\r\n\r\nO: It\u2019s not a bad beer. Nor is it interesting, complex, or subtly executed.
