Aroma is floral (it smells a bit like women\u2019s perfume, I got some white rose and lavender there), woody and slightly fruity (orange peel). Dry, moderately bitter and citrusy taste, decent hoppy aftertaste. Palate is surprisingly smooth without being watery, is this a nitro can? Kinda tastes like it and the ridiculous foam retention would speak for this too. Anyway, one of the best beers I\u2019ve had from this style so far, of course nowhere near a solid IPA, for me at least, but sometimes a normal pale ale is just the right thing, and this one is remarkably well executed.", "Pours a dark amber from a can.

It has a nice bite as it hits the tongue and mellows quickly before it even hits the palate. The palate keeps a nice even bitter taste though. This is more an IPA than a pale ale, in my opinion.

Lemon invites a prominent dryness to the otherwise very malty beer, giving it an inviting hop character, which then results into a long lasting, lemony dryness.

Perfect for a picnic but I wouldn\u2019t have too many - not a session beer!", "Pours golden with a white head. Aroma is citrus with pine. Flavor is citrus up front with a dry malt backbone and a pine hops finish. Nice crisp, clean, hoppy brew. Classic pale ale.", "It has been quite some years now since I first saw canned American craft beers and I remember being a bit skeptical about them, associating cans with metallic taste and cheaply made, bland beer styles, primarily lager and strong lager for alcoholics. Now I like them a lot, with the cans being lined with polymer in between the beer and the metal eliminating the metallic flavour; the countless craft beer cans are appealing to the eye, practical in use and protect the beer from light and oxygen probably better than a glass bottle does. This Dale\u2019s Pale Ale started the canned craft beer movement with the intention of being able to easily take good beer outdoors on a walk in the Rocky Mountains, so I am happy to be able to taste one. It has a practically clear but eventually hazy, very warm and deep amberish orange colour with vivid fizz, supporting a creamy, moussy, complexely lacing, egg-white head with good retention. Lovely dry-hopped, blossomy and fruity aroma jumps into the nose, of overripe papaja, pink grapefruit, damp pine wood, soap, chicken stock, cookies, rose petals, hint of burnt toast and roasted pine nuts, bitter honey, tulips. Crisp, refreshing onset of redcurrant, mango, pineapple and starfruit, so a touch exotic but not overly so, sweetish with sourish balance further increased by a well-attenuated carbonation; a vague salty accent announces hoppiness, but passes through a soft, very bready, even somewhat biscuity malt flavour; the hoppiness, established by the three classic C-hops Centennial, Columbus and Cascade then blossoms in the finish, resiny, spicy, citrussy, notably piney, with an explicitly drying and bittering effect, very long and very quenching. Exemplary APA, less \u2019agressive\u2019 than your average modern-day American style IPA with more bready malt sweetness coming through. I would recommend this as a perfect introduction to the APA style, and the can proves its point: the beer was canned fourteen months ago and I am eager to assume it would have been too \u2019old\u2019 and weak in aroma if it had been simply bottled, but in this vessel, it has kept an unexpectedly large amount of its delicate hop fragrance.  I guess canned IPAs can be stored longer than bottled IPAs then, but I have yet to gain more experience with this.  Time to experiment!", "HOPS very hoppy taste and aroma. From start to finish its pretty smooth with a bit of an after taste that lingers.", "Surprisingly enough coming from a can it\u2019s pretty good! It\u2019s not as good as some pale ales i\u2019ve had, but it comes through. I would buy it again! Check out my full video review of this beer at youtube.com/shaftyfingers", "On tap at Cork and Cask.

Tasty", "Can from systemet in Uddevalla, one of the regulars in Sweden:) Fresh, crisp and hoppy, love it!", "Pours golden amber with thin, quickly dissolving head. Aroma is very faint. Some hops and a little pine, but surprisingly how little there is. Taste is big and bold and makes up for it.
