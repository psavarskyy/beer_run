The head has a moderate level of retention, fading over about a 5 min time period to leave a lighter level of lace on the sides of the glass.\r\n\r\n Smell \u2013 The nose is quite heavy of an orange citrus mixed with lots of grainy wheat. Along with these smells is a yeasty nature as well as a little bit of cardamom and clove spice. Rounding these smells out are some grassy and more herbal hop aromas giving a rather nice mellow smell overall.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste begins, as the nose would have suggested, with a wheaty and orange citrus flavor. As the flavor advances, the yeasty flavors come along and bring with them flavors of a light corriander spice and some banana. A grassy flavor comes to the tongue more toward the middle of the taste and gets slightly stronger as the taste advances to the end. Along with the grassy flavor, the wheaty flavor grows in strength and becomes more grainy with more yeasty flavors coming to the tongue as well. With the mix of flavors that reside at the end, a rather grainy wheat and yeasty citrus flavor is left to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\n Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the average to slightly creamier side for a brew of 5.8% abv with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly above average. The creamier body is very nice for the wheaty and grainy flavors of the brew while the citrus is nicely accentuated by the moderate to slightly higher carbonation. \r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A nice drinking American Pale ale with a good blend of wheat, yeast, citrus and grassy flavors.

The very clean, light aromas of flowers, grass, lemon, lime, orange (I guess general citrus would be appropriate, although I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m picking up the distinct differences), and even peaches give this a true springtime feel. There\u2019s also some pine and a touch of toasted grain underneath. The beer is a very murky apricot flesh color (kinda dull yellow-brown) with a fluffy white head that retains well and leaves a light, but puffy lace jutting out along the sides of the glass (should anything less be expected from a wheat ale?). For a wheat ale, this actually has a significant bitter bite to it, I\u2019d say a medium level bitterness (lighter end of medium) with a medium / medium-light, dull sweetness. The body is medium light and full of lots of fizzy carbonation. The texture is fairly thin and watery, but it\u2019s very crisp and refreshing with a dried citrus peel and grain finish.

Honestly it has a little bit of a funk to it that I wasn\u2019t expecting. Flavor is lighter than the nose would suggest.
