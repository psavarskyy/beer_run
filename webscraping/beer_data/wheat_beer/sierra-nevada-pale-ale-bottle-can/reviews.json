Good classic ale", "Well, after many years and many beers (too many to remember which is why I rate them here), I\u2019ve finally reached the 1000 mark. It\u2019s been a lot of fun (and sometimes a lot of work when I just wanted to drink the beer and relax). As I approached number 1000, I was trying to decide what beer I should choose for it. I thought about getting a really exotic, hard to find beer that would be a trophy for 1000, but when I really thought about it, I decided that it should be something near and dear to my (beer) heart. Once I figured that out, the choice wasn\u2019t that hard. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a landmark beer to almost all American craft beer lovers. Sure there was New Albion (and its founder Jack McAuliffe) which isn\u2019t available anymore, and Anchor Brewing (and Fritz Maytag) with its long history. But I think Sierra Nevada and its founder Ken Grossman more than any other craft brewery really broke open the doors to making and selling great beer commercially in America again, and those doors remained opened for many others who would follow in the years to come. It was the Pale Ale that did it and it remains a true icon of what craft beer is about. While the Pale Ale isn\u2019t my favorite beer (or even my favorite Sierra Nevada beer, which would probably have to be Celebration Ale), it represents a milestone in craft beer in America and that seemed like a perfect reason to make it my 1000th rating. And here it is: 24 oz. bomber (thanks as always for the extra 2 oz., Ken!) from Albertsons in Tustin, CA. poured into a Sierra Nevada tulip pint glass, of course! Beautiful, very clear golden amber body with a billowing white head. Aroma of pine needles with some woody notes in the back. More pine and toasted wood bitterness with a bit of peppery spice in the taste along with some citrus rind and a touch of orange/lemon flavor. Nice caramel sweetness with a touch of vanilla to balance out the bitterness. And the subtle bready, yeasty flavor that gives that special touch to so many SN beers. Even though it\u2019s only 5.6% ABV, I think the bitterness gives it just enough bite to make it noticeable. Leaves a long-lasting dry woody flavor on the tongue and lingering pine cone in the aftertaste. Everything about this beer is about balance and flavor. I\u2019ll have to admit I enjoyed this more than I remember from my many past encounters with it. I\u2019m looking forward to doing a comparison to the draft version when I get a fresh pint from the SN taproom in Chico next time I\u2019m there. Cheers to a great beer, a great brewery, and to my next 1000 ratings!", "Clear orange beer, with standard carbonation and a nice foam head.

Good clean easy going. me enjoy", "I\u2019ve had this beer a hundred times, and have never poured it. Its my go to beer on the golf course, and I golf year round. Frigid temperatures and temp greens never stopped me. I\u2019ve never had a complaint about this beer, and have never considered switching to a new golf beer. Inviting citrus forward aroma. Crisp, lighter side pale, with a citrus fruit that lingers. Slightly sweet. Enjoyable every time. Quite thankful that every golf course in the world carries it.", "Bottle 0,33ltr: Slightly hazy orange colored brew with an dry bitter taste with hints of caramel and citrus.", "This beer is excellent. Beer is my drink of choice, but for some reason this beer has seemed to escape me. Taste is sweet but not too sweet. Slight slight bitterness, with great hop flavor. Malt is spot on too. I feel like i can definitely taste some caramel. Color is a nice copper..... wish i could get my homebrew this clear. Great job Sierra Nevada.", "Copper colour, crystal-clear, weak head.\nSmell is subtle. Caramel, resin, hint of hop bitterness.\nTaste is fizzy bitterness. Quite full. Refreshing. Hint of maltiness and lots of hoppy bitterness, fading into a strong astringent finish. Almost salty.", "The distinct flavor of Sierra Nevada. Goes down like any other beer but has a distinct bitter aftertaste.", "Bottle. Golden color. Aroma of bitter grassy hop, malt and yeast. Taste has grainy malt, crispy hop, mild piney citrus and some grassy note. Solid.", "Bottle. Pours a copper color with white head. Herbal, earthy, hoppy aromas with notes of maltiness in background.

Overall- A classic beer that holds up to modern craft. Accessible without sacrificing flavour.", "12-ounce bottles in a pint glass. Not so much a pale ale as an India Pale Ale. However, with as overly hopped as many of their beers are, I guess compared to them this one wouldn\u2019t be quite so bitter.", "Truly don\u2019t like this. Cascade is hideous, lager/epa like hop. I only drink beer for these new fandangled fruity new world hops, not boring English tasting floral spicey rubbish. But at least I\u2019ve narrowed down that filthy hop at last, this is why ratebeer is such a good idea.", "Bottle. Pours orange with a white head. Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Taste is sweet but the finish is bitter.", "Dammit. I thought I\u2019d be the first to review this... Ok, lets assume this is my 9 millionth so I best actually do this. Caramel, soft sweet orange, toasted malts, bit o pine, honey aroma. Mellow yet obvious bitterness. Bready malts with the caramel being minor, orange, pine, more citrus, the underbelly of faint spice. Finishes clear. Yumtime.", "11/20 not spectacular but a decent pub/supermarket option. Piney taste, mild bitterness, easy to drink but not enough flavour for me \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Crisp, grasy, getreidig, citrusfrisch und rundum das Kippbier.
