I couldn\u2019t think of much to write about this one, but I finally had a chance to try some and wanted to get some basic thoughts down. It\u2019s usually not been available in my area and is too expensive at it\u2019s regular price here, but I found some that were available and on sale. It didn\u2019t blow me away, but there were no noticeable deficiencies- good hops profile with the expected amount of hops, not watery, etc.. Definitely a good solid IPA that any IPA drinker should find a reasonable representation of the style, and a lot better than the rush of beers we see getting labeled IPAs for marketing reasons that aren\u2019t true IPAs. This is a true IPA. Having said that, I don\u2019t understand what the hype is about, really- it\u2019s not anything spectacular except in the way that a good IPA is always spectacular to people who like IPAs. I would give a slight edge to the Sierra Nevada Torpedo on taste, and, in my area, I can get 12 of those for $3.50 more than 6 of these cost (with no 12 packs available locally) when both are at the regular prices. On sale, it was a fine value, but I can\u2019t think of a reason to buy this over a Torpedo when it\u2019s not on-sale, and it passes over the 6-pack spending limit I\u2019ve set for myself at it\u2019s regular price. Now, perhaps the regular pricing listed was because it\u2019s new to my area or outside their core midwestern distribution heartland (Brewery is in Michigan) or whatever, and it\u2019s a bit less expensive closer to the brewery relative to it\u2019s national competition- in which case I would totally understand why this is a lot of people\u2019s go-to everyday beer.", "cloudy reddish amber with medium head. lively carbonation hint of citrus smell.

Nice citrus and grapefruit aroma although not as big as I expected. Clear amber with some slight haze. Medium white head with good lacing. Bread and caramel sweetness and mild dryness. Citrus and pine are in the back of the palate. A solid IPA. Wish I could taste this fresh but is always a couple months old here..always.", "Have had bottles and on tap. No detailed notes here - everyone has said it. Very good, well-balanced IPA."]}
