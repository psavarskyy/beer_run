Medium to light bodied. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Transfer from BA review on 12-10-12-\r\n Poured from bottle into pint glass\r\n\r\n Appearance- Pours a light brown- mahogany color with a big off white head. The head has a great level of retention hanging around for quite some time with it very slowly fading to give a great level of lacing.\r\n\r\n Smell - The aroma is of a malty and nut aroma. The malty aroma is mostly of a brown bread nature and is complimented well by a caramel and toffee sweetness smell. The nut smell is a nice blend of a walnut and almond aroma which when combined with the sweet smells creates a great nut brown aroma overall.\r\n\r\nTaste \u2013 The taste starts out with some sweet caramel and a malty flavor of a brown bread nature. Nutty flavors of a mostly walnut nature become more and more prevalent as the taste advances. An almost cider like flavor also develops more toward the middle of the taste. This results in a sweetening of the beer, which over time then starts to fade as the caramel and toffee loss some ground. A grassy and earthy hop flavor come to the taste at the end, bittering the taste ever so slightly. With the lessening of some of the sweetness that was originally upfront, a bready, walnut, and lightly grassy hop flavor are left to linger on the tongue.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel \u2013 The body of the brew is a little on the thinner side with a carbonating level that is on the below average to average side. Not bad, although a little more creaminess and chewiness may have been better for the nut and bready flavors of the brew.\r\n\r\nOverall- A easy drinking nut brown. Not the smoothest of flavor transitions and a little weak in body, but still one to try if you get a chance.", "Roasted caramel malts and gently sweet fruits, but a little too little of both.
