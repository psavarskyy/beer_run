Juicy, pineapple, orange and tropical fruit aromas from a slightly hazy medium orange/yellow body with a foamy white head.  The juiciness in the aroma gives way to a fairly dry, bracing bitterness that still has some pineapple but much more grapefruit and citrus pith.  The balance of dry bitterness to juicy fruit sweetness is what makes this such a classic IPA.  Not to heavy, not to light, and just strong enough at 6.9% ABV to make it spicy but maintain that balance.  There's also a distinctive hop spiciness that lays down on the tongue and stays there.
