I guess I\u2019m a little picky in some respects for a guy who\u2019ll drink adjunct lagers when finances dictate- I enjoy some malty beers, but when they taste a little too much like candy, that can be a turn-off, and when they get a little too roasted and burnt, that can be a turn-off. This definitely is not the latter. It has some aspects of the former, but skirts the line nicely with the upfront hoppiness and not overdoing it on the backend sweetness despite the base backend flavor being similar to beers that cross the line. I would say a good beer, but not spectacular.  Nicely avoids some common pitfalls, but it\u2019s aim isn\u2019t to the side of the bock equation I\u2019d aim for.
