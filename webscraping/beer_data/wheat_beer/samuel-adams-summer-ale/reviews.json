Decent retention and lacing. 2/3\n\nFLAVOR: A bready/dough taste accounts for a strong portion of the palette; though a strong spicy flavor is almost as prominent.

Apologies, future ratings will have detail.", "Unlike Leinie\u2019s Summer Shandy this Sam Adams brew is pretty flat. The lemon flavor is hardly noticeable, there is no aroma at all, and it doesn\u2019t provide the palate kick needed on those hot Texas summer days. Leave it up North.", "Not much selection at Atlanta\u2019s historic Fox Theatre.  As I planned on doing a touch of dancing, I went with this lighter beer.  Poured a hazy yellow with a smallish white head.  Scent was citrus and taste was mildly sweet with a hint of lemon.  Not anything special.  Right beer for the time, place and selection.  Draft - Fox Theatre - Atlanta, GA", "12oz bottle. Hazy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma of fruity wheat, lemon ant light banana. Flavor is crisp wheat malt, citrus and some spicy esters. Light body with average carbonation. Fresh, zesty and drinkable", "Light citrusy flavor- reminiscent of the summer shandy, minus the sweetness and overall not as refreshing.", "Drought. Rich yellow with whitish spongy small head, doughy aroma, sour yeeast taste, long slightly bitter finish. Not as good as I expected.", "Decent for what it is. Aroma was wheat and citrus but not at the witbier level. Clear yellow gold color with a white fizzy head. The palate was light and crisp with good carbonation. There was a slight pucker factor but not enough to distract. Flavors are light and of citrus fruits but the wheat backbone is strong enough to handle. A lighter beer but easy to drink and a good alternative to macro beers.", "Straight out of the bottle. Prominent lemon note in the nose. Little kind of something to.in the mouth it\u2019s a light ale with a easy malt background and lemon peel verging on fake extract. Finished slightly malty.fair summer super nothing spectacular.", "Pours a hazy golden, scent of banana and wheat. Tasted similar with some spice. A pretty wheat ale.", "Not a big fan, on tap at O?Brien?s in Santa Monica, light and refreshing, hints of lemon. Copper pour, white head, nose is grassy, taste is lemon zest.", "Not one of S.A.\u2019s better brews. I will take a Leinenkugels Summer Shandy over this anyday.", "On tap in a 20 oz Sam Adams glass... Pretty weird taste overall.  Don't taste any citrus or hoppiness at all.  Almost a sour, yeasty flavor (skunkiness).  I got through this beer, but I wouldn't have it again.\n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Smells tart and lemony.  Pours murky straw with a thin white head.  Taste is mostly bland with a hint of citrus.", "Bottle from a Summer Variety pack. Pours a hazy pale gold with a small white head. Aroma of malt,  light hop and lemon. Flavor is wheat with some floral notes from hops and a little spice and citrus. Decent.", "Apricot with foamy white head. Lagery aroma. Flavor is fairly lagery, pretty bad.", "Taste is light skunky and a mild lemon. Pours cloudy with a small head that lingers. Would not buy again.", "Fuller beer than porch rocker, but still nice and light. Not as good as other Sam Adams beers.", "Bomber from the Citgo station across the street. Pours slightly hazy gold with a nice pillow of white head that fades pretty fast. Aroma is slightly yeasty and lemony with nice floral hop notes. Taste is great. Spicy, light white bread crispness, tropical fruits, incredibly refreshing. Finishes with a nice slight dryness.", "nice aroma, nice head. nice light citrus flavor, slight spiciness. very refreshing summer beer", "Pending a better offer, this is the beer if Summer. Eager to please, easy to spend time with, and easily forgotten once the leaves change color. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Light and refreshing for hot summer day. Subtle, not overpowering, citrus taste with a crisp finish.", "Very average wheat beer on the smell and appearance. The texture and the taste however where a bit strange. Slick mouth feel accompanied by some buttery diacetyl notes that I couldn\u2019t ignore. Otherwise standard wheat beer with some lemony citrus notes. Tried twice on draft this month and both times could not get over the buttery flavor and feel. Unfortunate as I usually can rely on Sam Adams for a decent pint when I end up stuck in a chain restaurant with poor tap selection. Would rather have the lager next time.", "Poured from 12 oz. bottle to Samuel Adams tulip glass. Smells sour, lots of wheat notes with hints of citrus and lemon. Taste is lemony and refreshing yet sour. Seems like they wanted to go for a fruit beer without the overwhelming fruit taste. Finishes nicely with a little carbonated bite at the end.", "Hazy gold with lasting thin foamy head; aroma of wheat and grain and lager yeast; Flava is light and slightly citrusy; feels light and fizzy; finishes dryish with some citrusy sweetness", "On tap in McFadden\u2019s NYC. Light hazy golden colour. Slightly grainy, light slightly fruity hop flavour, typical wheat sweetish finish. Something a bit artificial about the fruity flavour.", "Pours hazy golden with minimal head. Aroma of grain , bread, slight lemony nose. Taste is very weizen without the banana and bubblegum . Finish is chalky dry and abrupt. So-so.", "Looks a lot like a Shock Top or a Blue Moon.  Much milder taste though.  Very good. No strong after taste.  Would drink again. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Lemon, honey-like aroma. Sweet malt flavor; also some bready/doughy malt. Lemony, with a hint of pepper.", "Tap. Hazy yellow with white head and decent lacing. Smells like dirty pennies. Tastes lightly floral and citrus. Slightly grainy.", "Light golden with a thin white head. Aroma is lemony. Flavor is light and lemony with a bit of tartness on the finish. A little dry and maybe a touch over carbonated. Vaguely reminiscent of soda, but not horrible outside on a hot day. Wouldn\u2019t be my first choice though.", "Pours golden with a bit of head. Aroma is a combination malty hay and a hint of lemon. A light body and crisp finish make for a very refreshing summer beer", "On tap at the West Palm Beach airport in the Sam Adams brewshop. Pours orangey-yellow with a white head. Aroma has fruitiness and wheat. Taste follows; sweet fruits, grainy dry wheat. Summery is right. Light-ish and tasty enough.", "Pretty solid surprisingly.  Clean, crisp, & well balanced w/ just enough flavor to make this an enjoyable brew.", "had this on draft at Dueces.  Golden cloudy orange pour with medium white head.  decent bitter wheat taste, slight hops in here.  would drink this outside in the sun in the  summer anytime, but wouldn\u2019t buy or order it to sit around", "On draft in beaver falls pa.  Pours a cloudy pale amber with an off white head.  Peach aroma.  Flavors of coriander and all spice with a malty backbone.", "Pours hazy gold, head disappears quick. Nose of orange, cherry, and pistachio. The aroma reminds me of my favorite Amaretto-Spumoni cheesecake! Great light fruity flavors, lemon wheat standing out. Great beer!", "I like summer beers but I am not a huge fan of this one.  Smells of lemon but unfortunately does not come out very strong on the taste buds. Pours hazyy.", "Pours a hazy golden brown with a small white head. Some citrus, wheat, pretty sweet. Just ok. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Very light Summery beer! I love the flavor and citrus notes. Definitely one of my favorites.", "Shared bottle, pour to shaker.  Had the perfect setting for a wheat ale: sitting on the deck on a beautiful warm spring evening.  The beer just didn\u2019t measure up.  It was okay: some zest and crispness.  But it was thin on the palate and not particularly satisfying.", "Just didn't like this one. No depth of flavor which is atypical of SA. The Noble Pilsner is MUCH better although I realize its a different style. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Bottle.  Faint citrus aroma.  Medium carbonation.  Muted hoppy flavor with very faint lemon/citrus tones.  Overall, it doesn\u2019t provide enough hoppy flavor that I\u2019d expect from a Sam Adams beer, and doesn\u2019t provide nearly enough lemon flavor that I\u2019d expect from a summer ale.  Sam Adams Porch Rocker takes this beer/citrus formula to a much higher level, and is much more satisfying.", "This beer just made my top 10 best beers of all time. Outstanding taste!! Perfect warm weather beer. It has a solid body and plenty of flavor (lemon, wheat) but its not over-powering with the hops that Sam Adams tends oversell. If you dont like this beer, then you wont like any beer. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "4 oz. from bottle at a Sam Adams dinner/beer pairing benefit at Old Line Wine's The Bistro in Beltsville, MD. \n\nLightly hazy, light straw color with an off-white head and good lacing. \n\nVery light aroma of lemon and wheat. \n\nLight taste of lemon, wheat and herbs. \n\nLight/medium body and medium/high carbonation. \n\nNot much here to especially enjoy, but nothing bad here.  I just found it to be a boring beer. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "On tap. Definately taste the citrus but not overpowering. I think I could drink a few of these after mowing. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Pours a golden color with a white head.  Grassy aroma with a hint of floral hop, lemon, and some spices.  Flavor is all grass and earthy tones with some lemon and not much else. Not really a very good summer beer.", "12 fl oz / 355mL bottle into a Samuel Adams glass. Served cold.\r\n\r\nAroma: Lemons. Sour wheat. Maybe some spice. Smells pretty refreshing.\r\n\r\nAppearance: A hazy, barely translucent dark yellow with a persistent soapy, white head.\r\n\r\nTaste: Pretty lemony! A little sweet even. Definite wheat presence. Very nice.\r\n\r\nPalate: Not heavy, but not thin or watery at all; light and refreshing, but with nice character.\r\n\r\nOverall: A good summer ale indeed. The lemon flavor doesn\u2019t overpower and make this sickly sweet or super lemony. It\u2019s a good, lemony beer.", "Lager glass. Hints of apricot, lemons and wheat. Cloudy gold, lots of carbonation bubbles but that\u2019s it. Apricot taste with a bit of wheat. A little watered down.", "On draught during a brewery tour. One of the worst things I have tasted from Sam and I know it was fresh because I had it at the brewery. Bland, watery and just not good.", "Its a decent beer, but i wouldnt classify it as a good wheat beer.  Its a hazy yellow with minimal head and no lacing.  Almost no wheat taste and a little to crisp to be a wheat", "Used to think this was my favorite summer ale, how things have changed, will always make me think of summer though", "Slightly hazy yellow beer.  Tart astringent nose with a little basement yeast.  Tastes of rye-like spice, belgian yeast, brine and some basement.  Slight mouth puckering effect but not tart as it smells.  This one\u2019s good.", "Not bad. On draft at the Outback. No rules...just right. Served in a big bloke (24oz mug) twice. Aroma was light tropical fruit. Peaches, lemon, citrus, wheat and grain, and sweet honey. Pour is golden orange with a foamy white head. Taste matches up, being a touch on the sweet side. A good dose of wheat on the finish with lemon and citrus notes throughout. Not a bad drinker.", "Draft at the brewery. Pours cloudy amber orange with a light foamy head. Has the ancient grains of paradise. Medium body. Tastes like wheat with hints of orange. Smells like citrus and herbs.", "Tap at brewery. Pours hazy gold with thick, frothy white head; good retention and some lacing. Aroma is cereal and biscuit malts, citrus fruit, lemon peel, floral hops, light spice, and light herbs. Flavor is sweet, bready malts forward with supporting light fruit esters, citrus and floral hops, and some herbs; dry finish. Light body and low carbonation.", "Bottle at noodle zoo... pours orange very cloudy.. clean fresh aroma...taste is probably one if the best summer ales ive had in a long time.. will probsbly go pick up a 6 of this... good breakfast beer", "Aromas of lemon candy, orange peel, and wild flowers.  Hazy orange with a lasting, white head.  Dry, fruity, citrusy, and biscuity.  Light body, smooth, with zippy carbonation, and a clean finish."]}
