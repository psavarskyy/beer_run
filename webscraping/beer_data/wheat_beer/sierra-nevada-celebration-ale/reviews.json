I would definitely recommend this to any IPA lover as a good holiday brew(Note: 2010 edition).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2011 Edition\r\n\r\nThis beer was served out of a 12oz. bottle dispensed into a glass....\r\n\r\nPresentation - Same label and look of the 2010 edition only has 2011 stamped on it. Very nice.\r\n\r\nAppearance - SNCA2011 pours out the same beautiful amber color with a light and airy 2 finger foam golden white foam head that slowly fades to a nice frothy coating.\r\n\r\nSmell - Smells of strong floral/citrusy/piney hops. Some hints of bready malts as well. A very nice, big smell.\r\n\r\nTaste - Tastes very piney on the front end before the floral/citrusy hop flavor takes over. In my opinion SNCA2011 was a bit more hopped than the 2010 edition.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel - Very nice amount of carbonation with a medium bodied feel. In my opinion SNCA2011 has a bit more body than the 2010 edition and has a slightly creamy feel.\r\n\r\nDrinkability - Excellent taste and smell to go along with being medium bodied and moderately carbonated make this an extremely drinkable offering.\r\n\r\nCelebration never disappoints. While the profile is slightly different from year to year it is always an exceptional brew!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2012 Edition\r\n\r\nPresentation: SNCA 2012 sports the same basic label artwork and setup as 2011 with the exception of the 2012 marking on the neck. Neck label gives a fine description of the beer and has the 2012 marking. Front label has the festive artwork in the traditional SN style. Rear label has a nice back story on the beer, ABV info, and website info.\r\n\r\nAppearance: I poured this from its 12oz bottle into a 16oz English Pint. SNCA2012 pours out a clear copper orange color with a 2 finger white foam head of light density. Head retention is exceptional lasting a full 4min before fading to a thick coating and ring. Lacing was very good.\r\n\r\nSmell/Aroma: Smells of fresh hops with a citrus and piney scent very prevalent. A slight caramel malt scent can be detected as well.\r\n\r\nFlavor/Taste: Tastes follows the nose as the citrus and piney hops rule. A biscuit-like toasty malt flavor is detected on the front end that gives way to an intense hop bitterness on the finish. Very well balanced flavor profile.\r\n\r\nMouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with a slick almost creamy mouthfeel. Above average amount of carbonation. Insanely drinkable with an excellent profile across the board.\r\n\r\nOverall/Comments: SNCA is a completely different beer from nearly all that one will find offered in the winter seasonals. An excellent twist on the traditional classic American IPA. The fresher the better with SNCA. A true classic every year and SNCA2012 held true to form. Classified as an American IPA at 6.8% ABV. Consumed 1/11/13. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2013 Edition\r\n\r\nPresentation: Awesome label in the SNBC tradition that the festive SNCA feel with awesome eye-catching graphics and colors. Front label gives a bit of brewery info. Back label gives web info, ABV info, and a nice backstory on the beer. Neck label give vintage (2013) and a nice description of the beer.\r\n\r\nAppearance: An aggressive pour from it 12oz brown bottle into a 16oz English pint led to a 3 finger white head of a medium rocky density atop a deep orange/copper/amber colored beer. Head retention was an awesome 5min 27 sec before fading to a thick coating and ring with phenomenal lacing. \r\n\r\nSmell/Aroma: Smell is of piney resin hops with nice herbal tone. Citrus aromas are very prevalent along with a nice caramel maltiness. \r\n\r\nFlavor/Taste: Tastes is of very piney resin on the front end with a sweet maltiness that balances out the resin very well. A sweet citrus hop flavor that blends nicely with a bready biscuit maltiness at the midpoint. Back end quickly turns pine hop bitter with a resin herbal aftertaste. \r\n\r\nMouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with a slick and creamy mouthfeel. The perfect amount of carbonation make this very drinkable. \r\n\r\nOverall/Comments: A truly great seasonal treat that I look forward to every year. The fresh hops are the star every year! A must drink! Consumed 1-21-14. Classified as an American IPA @ 6.8%ABV.", "B\u00e4rnsten med stort ljust skum. Doft av tropiska toner och lite s\u00f6tma.

Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.\n\nThis makes for a great old school IPA with a certain East Coast vibe, the bitter, resinous hops being balanced against a strong, slightly sweet malt backbone perfectly. The first time I had this it was over two years old and I was really impressed by how much resinous bitterness was still left in it, although the sweet malts had clearly taken over. Now, at four months old, those bitter, resinous hops and citrus notes clearly shine through a lot more distinctly, makinf for and even more enjoyable brew. There certainly is a reason that this is a classic and I really wish that I could get my hands on this even more fresh and regularly, although it really is a beer that keeps up incredibly well.", "Keg at Rose and Thistle, Frimley.

Every year I've given it a stellar rating because it's consistently good.

Do tego pomara\u0144cza i cynamon, dojrzale mango i ananas, grejpfrut. \r\n\r\nUSTA : piwo jest symbolicznie nasycone i puszyste o t\u0142ustej teksturze. \r\n\u015awietnie (czytaj nudno) wywa\u017cone pomi\u0119dzy gorzkimi nutami chmiel\u00f3w ameryka\u0144skich a s\u0142odkimi nutami s\u0142odu z lekk\u0105 dominacj\u0105 s\u0142odkiej tarty.

Upfront sweetish, near-medicinal nose of a pine, quince and pineapple rind reduction. Taste sees more of that same unripe orchard fruit bitterness best described as quinces, mercifully underlaid with some cookie dough caramels and honey. Lingering piney finish, bittering and aroma hops slowly working their way into palate and enamel.

The hops and malt are well balanced, neither really overpowering the other.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nT - Starts off with a nice dose of citric hop bitterness quickly giving way to a mix of sweet caramel malts, fresh baked bread, and some sticky pine resin. It is fairly well balanced but the sweetness is beginning to creep up. The finish is a mix of light sweetness and bitterness, lingering on the pallet for some time.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nM - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, slightly sticky, feel that makes it ever so easy to drink.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nO - This one remains one of my go to fall beers. The balance of sweetness to bitterness is spot on and it goes down easy. One of the rare IPA\u2019s that gets better with age.", "Transfer from BA reveiw on 11-27-12-\r\n Served on tap in a pint glass\r\n\r\n Appearance \u2013 The beer is served an amber color with a two finger white head. The head fades slowly over time to give a decent level of lacing.\r\n\r\nSmell \u2013 The aroma is heaviest of some biscuit malt, hop, and a spice. The spice is light overall with the hop aromas are of a pine and grapefruit citrus in nature.\r\n\r\n Taste \u2013 The taste starts with a bready and roasted flavor. A light sweetness of fruit and caramel is present upfront, which fades as the taste advances further. Spice and hop flavors soon come to the tongue. The spice flavors are the light just as the nose would have suggested and with the loss of some of the sweetness and the new presence of a pine and grapefruit hop flavors, bring a bitter spiced and bready flavor to linger on the tongue at the very end of the taste. \r\n\r\n Mouthfeel \u2013 The body of the beer is medium in thickness with a carbonation level that is quite average. Not bad for the roasted and spiced flavors of the brew with the moderate carbonation level maintaining a good drinkability.\r\n\r\n Overall \u2013 A decent brew. A little bitter for a winter brew, as the bitterness and the spice don\u2019t meld perfectly, but overall not bad.", "Old golden color with creamy big head. Nice malty and fresh hernal aroma, also citrus and piney. Light sweet with soft pleasant bitterness.", "Out of the bottle. Definitively enjoyed the wet hopped. A bit of good spice taste. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "2013 Celebration. An orange beer with a big and blond head. The nose has caramell, citrusfruits and pine, some tropical fruits, also woods to indicate some aging. Taste has caramell, pine needles, also wood, nice and quite strong bitterness. Menthol and resin in the long-lasting end. Medium bodied, fresh carbonation, nicely smooth to drink. Unfortunately, the age has robbed the best aromaticity, but good beer anyway with a strong hoppyness.", "355 ml bottle as a gift by WheatKing at Q Club in SoHo, Central. Thanks Adam!\r\n\r\n\n\nLooks: Cloudy hazy amber honey colour with no yeast sediments;Three-quarter finger head and off-white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.\r\n\r\n\n\nAroma: Fragrant and sweet Ale malt, with fresh grapefruit, pineapple, floral nectar, honey, caramel, strong pine, resin, strong yeast, light lemon and thin grass.\r\n\r\n\n\nTaste: Mid to light sweet Ale malt, with grapefruit flesh and zest, light caramel, molasses, strong pine, very light resin, very light alcohol, earth, spices, light biscuits, light lime, bitter hops, and pretty sharp grass.\r\n\r\n\n\nBody: Medium; Slightly oily and oozy palate.\r\n\r\n\n\nMouth Feel: Moderate Ale maltyness with good touches of caramel. Good fruity citrus. Very strong pine but not really resiny. Lack of yeast in bottle means lesser biscuits. The rest are full sharp hoppiness. Pretty well balanced. Gooood!\r\n\r\n\n\nHoppiness: Fragrant grapefruit pineapple, floral nectar, strong pine in nose. Quite refreshing citrus zest, strong pine, light resin, earth, spice and light lime in taste. Bitterness is strong, smart and neat, but not as bitter and astringent as typical German Pils. Work well with the light resin for a lasting, mid-to-strong bitter finish.\r\n\r\n\n\nAfter Taste: Fairly dry after taste. Hoppy, spicy and delicate to mouth.\r\n\r\n\n\nComments: Most American craft IPAs I had were very malty and heavy, not this one: SN really know their stuff and this one is typically strong in pine and fruity aroma, yet the body, taste and hoppiness is lighter without being compromised. Everything is done with a delicate touch, which is well-suited for X\u2019mas but what the hack. An excellent IPA!"]}
