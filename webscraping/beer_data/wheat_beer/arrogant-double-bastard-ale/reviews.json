Magnificent.", "Bottle, 660ml. A clear reedish beer with a medium size brown head and minimal sediments. Aroma is of firewood, malt, alcohol and spices. Taste is bitter with a strong malt backbone.

Perfect appearance: caramel brown with a thick head that lasts. Aroma was more restrained than I expected, perhaps due to the serving temperature. Brown sugar, brandied pears, raisins.

(That\u2019s not to denigrate the value of a boozy big bastard, mind you.) However, the other factor here is that a lot of the complexity and depth of flavour - and there\u2019s a lot - is overshadowed by the big malt and ABV, so to some extent it doesn\u2019t completely succeed, even on its own terms. When I first reviewed this, I opined that it might benefit from a greater hop presence, but even in a relatively fresh example, the hops are massively overshadowed by the the malt and alcohol.

Malt and slight orange peel aroma - nice! Alcohol not as forward as one would expect for an 11.2. Lingering bitter finish. Just reward after an out-n-back overnight backack/camping trip. Will be adding three to cellaring stock for annual reviews. Yum!", "2013 bottling\r\nAroma: Thick dried fruit, plums, raisins, slight caramel.\r\nAppearance: Deep cherry amber. Very little head. Tiny bubbled lacing that\u2019s edging towards brandy.\r\nTaste: Dried fruits, lots of sweetness to go with the alcohol, some piney hops, caramel. Every sip seems to reveal another layer. Cherries slipping into the picture now.\r\nPalate: Medium/full body, carbonation is more lively in the mouth than the glass. Starts off syrupy/stick and then slightly dry finish that bitters.\r\nOverall: This is a world tour of flavor and aroma. It really hides the abv well. I may prefer the oaked version for a more regular occasion, but this really knocks my socks off. Outstanding.", "This is such a badass beer. To me this tastes pretty much the same as Arrogant Bastard, just with more alcohol and perhaps a bit more character. I appreciate its complexity and its brazen character, but I can\u2019t say I really enjoy drinking it. But at the same time hell yeah I\u2019d drink it again.", "Stone\u2019s Bastard releases never fail to blow my mind. For me, Double Bastard proved to be every bit as enjoyable as the other releases that I\u2019ve, well, enjoyed (Arrogant Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard). The malty caramel note that this brew starts off with is sublime. The spicy, herbal hop kick that comes after that is even better. Did I say better than sublime? I suppose that doesn\u2019t make much sense. Yet, I do indeed consider Double Bastard to be twice as good as Arrogant Bastard. Admittedly, that\u2019s a paradox. I consider Arrogant Bastard to be perfect. How can something be two times more perfect? Exactly. Infinity times two still equals infinity. That\u2019s the nature of the Bastard series. Every beer is better than the last... even though the last one was perfect. Shit, maybe I shouldn\u2019t drink so much before I post these reviews... Anyway, Double Bastard has a gorgeous amber-red color with a lovely off-white head. Aroma has boozy sweetness, dark fruits, and pungent hops. My bomber was bottled on 9/01/2013 which meant I was a mere 2 months and 1 day away from a year-old bottle. Oh well. The hops were still plenty aggressive but a bit refined. One thing\u2019s for damn sure: the body was thick and the mouthfeel was warming in the best possible way. Okay, so I guess that was actually two things. Sue me. At the end of my tasting, I couldn\u2019t find any gripes with this beer. I also fully enjoyed reading the bottle notes. Any brewery that uses the word \"masturbatory\" when talking about their ale is okay by me. Double Bastard made my night by giving me balls-out flavor with a healthy dose of class.

The head fades fast to leave a very persistent white foam film on the top of the brew. \r\n\r\nSmell \u2013 A bready base aroma is mixed with huge hop aromas. There are big smells of bitter-resinous pine and citrus hop with other aromas of earthy nature. Mixed with all these are lighter fruit aromas and a good bit of alcohol aroma as well; rounding out the aroma profile well.\r\n\r\nTaste \u2013 Throughout the taste there is a massive bready malt flavor. There is a light amount of caramel and light fruit sweetness at first mixed with a citrus hop flavor. The hop flavors at the beginning, while average for an IPA, then really start to gain strength. Citrus and pine hops start getting strong and start to bring some bitterness. The caramel sweetness is largely lost, but the citrus is still there. While the pine and citrus get stronger, they get huge and other hop flavors of a resinous earthy taste come to the tongue. All the hop flavors mix quite well and take the taste to the end, where they are greeted with a warming and lightly burning alcohol flavor, which oddly in some ways complements the hop quite well.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel \u2013The body of the beer is creamy and chewy with all those flavors really coating the mouth in all the wonderful flavors. The lower carbonation only accentuates the creaminess with it also accentuating the hop and booze burn as well.\r\n\r\nOverall \u2013 Very heavy and tasty.

Where to start with the nose on this one ... well, I guess, at the start. The first aromas I picked up were that of vanilla and caramel primarily. After a little bit, some dark berry aromas start coming through followed shortly thereafter by a hint of nuts, figs, and plums. There\u2019s also some licorice tucked away in there. The next round of aromas had a bit of a musty and damp smell to it, but it was also accompanied by a hint of pine, wood, and honey. By the end of the drink, I was also picking up citrus, cuacao, as well as banana & clove notes. It pours a clear honey orange color with a thick, beige, sudsy head that\u2019s in no rush to recede. A healthy, rocky lacing is left behind on the glass. A medium-high bitter (fairly moderate by Stone standards) combines with a medium malty sweetness. This full bodied beer is creamy going down; aided by an abundant, yet mellow and soft carbonation. The malty front end is a toasted caramel and roasted nut flavor with some hints of dark, meaty fruits (figs / plums). Mid mid drink, this also takes on a woodsy quality as well.

Finish is very dry hop resin balanced with dark fruit sweetness and oaky hints.", "On tap at Special Brews, pours a slightly hazy copper color with a thick tan head that leaves good lacing. Smells of pine, citrus, and dark fruit. Tastes of the same things in the smell. Mouthfeel is slick and oily and well carbonated with a dry finish. This is a great strong ale. Good flavor with a good amount of sweetness. Better on tap then out of the bottle.", "Bottle from 16 Tons Taphouse via Jakeb, 2012 vintage. Pours a cloudy brownish orange. Little to no head, aroma big and broad, full of candi sugar. Body full and thick, still very hot, finishes hoppy and strong, lots of malt.", "I thought this was phenomenal. Aromas are sweet caramel malts, melon, bubblegum, and resin. This beer tastes like someone dipped a pine cone into honey. So good. Lacerative mofo indeed.", "Bottle to tulip\r\nSmells of spruce, pepper, pine, and booziness.\r\nSlightly reddish amber and a tan head.\r\nBitter, orange, grapefruit, and black pepper.\r\nMouthfeel is silky and oily, with an alcohol burn.", "Bottle - Malty caramel sweetness with a bit of earthy hops.

Good stuff.", "From a bottle. Very strong and very bitter beer. There\u2019s quite an amount of malty sweetness there too. Maybe a bit too much.", "Bomber from world beers. Pours dark amber. Thin white head. Scent of malt and caramel. Smells pretty boozy. Surprisingly hoppy. Would probably be even better if i give it 6 months. Still pretty tasty.", "I am not in love with Stone\u2019s Brew. Often than not they can have too much hop when it would be best to play up the floral aspects. Their smoked porter was too literal and therefore lost me. I did enjoy their Suede. It is an America Strong Ale. Foamy head. Dark amber hue. The spices seem to be lost in the boziness of it. And the dim body does nothing to support the overwhelming taste of alcohol. It seems like with their beers they try way too hard to get a point across with a hammer when a more approachable taste would serve better. Sometimes the overstated brew is, overstated...", "Not sure that this really deserves the 100 rating. It\u2019s very tasty, with big caramel bread malt flavor, but unlike most other Stone brews, there is not much hops in evidence. The high alcohol content is evident in the mouth feel!", "Dark amber color with a nice head. Great bitter flavor of hoppiness from heaven!

If you're a hop fan this is definitely a must for your list. \n\n---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone", "Pours into snifter with reddish brown hue. Sugared candied pineapples, apples and raisins in the nose. Complex flavors and really a lot going on as this opens up.

Nothing subtle about this beer. The flavors are upfront and intense. More bitter than I expected, but still very nice.

Aroma: caramel and roasted nuts, toffee, plums in syrup, a hint of woody booze\t.  Taste: brown sugar, raisin, caramel, candied nuts, a big wash of resinous, piney hops toward the back end.  Finish: slowly building boozy warmth grows over a lingering malty caramel and brown sugar thread, balanced by the lingering hoppy dryness. Notes: Definitely a big, strong ale, but it maintained a good semblance of balance and was surprisingly drinkable for an 11.2% beer--the alcohol was reasonably well-hidden.  Beerdvent 2013, day seven.", "Tap at stone brewing, escondido. Clear deep amber color, white head. Aroma is malts, oak, cherry, fruits, hops. Balanced malty body, big hops, some oak, fruits and some berries.", "Pours a murky orangish-red with a decent off-white head. Aroma is slightly boozy, nuts, dark fruits, brown sugar, and some hops. Bold flavor that kicks you right in the taste buds. Roasted nuts, malts, a hint of sweetness, and a surge of hop bitterness to keep you humble. This beer packs a punch at 11.2 percent and they do not hold back with the flavor profile. There really is not mistaking that you are drinking a very strong beer. Sometimes, that\u2019s exactly what you need though.", "2011 bottle, pours a deep murky brown with no head. Aroma big on malt with slight hop bitterness.

The aroma is rich citrus hoppiness with sweet malts. And yes this is hoppy and bitter. That said, comparing this with many contemporary west coast US style ales, not so unusual these days... actually nae, This is one rich hoppy bastard ! What I particularly like about this is the way that the relatively massive hop bitterness doesn\u2019t in any way derail the wonderful malts and hop flovours. It just works. They got this spot on, as they did with Arrogant. Had this a few times now and certainly will again.", "Pours burnt orange with some red flames amongst it. Large, impressive robust tan head - its like bubble-bath foam on bath water.\r\nHeavy hoppy aroma. Bitterness is invasive even in the aroma. Some toffee malt, heavily piney. Reminiscent of an even more brutal American DIPA. \r\nHeavy and strong mouth-feel. I should have worked out my jaw before chugging. Hop-forward pine strangles the wimpy citrus. Heavy sugary malt. Some caramelised fruit. Consuming, evolving and evolving bitterness. Wow, that has pummeled my taste buds. Does it NEED to be this bitter? No-one enjoys a mouthful of flies, surely?", "HOPS!

This dissipates rather quickly to a mirror surface and a central cap of foam. No lacing. Surprised at how turbid this is.\r\nS: Caramel malts, toffee, richly blended. Really nice smell, and for some reason, when I take a good long hit of this, I get candied and mulled orange smells. I dig it. Reminds me of a well aged barley wine.\r\nT: Sweet and bready with a midline transition highlighting the alpha acid in here. Then an additional mutation to a slightly oxidized and metallic grain bed. Above average for sure.\r\nM: Medium on heavy for the style with moderate to lo carb. Transient slick on the palate falls dry at the end.\r\nO: Good beer.

Nice soft aroma of fresh hops and citrus. Flavor belies the aroma, however. It is strongly malty with an intense bitter finish. \"Harsh\" might be the most suitable word here.
